# Visa For Lisa Project

Hey there! This is the work we've been doing for Galaxy Bank. The goal? Simple: turn those regular depositors into loan customers, while ensuring they grab more of Galaxy's financial products. Sounds like a plan, right?

## What's Cooking?

We're diving deep into customer data to see who's likely to say 'yes' to a loan. Why? Because we've got to get those marketing conversion rates up. Previously, the bank hit a 9% loan acceptance rate. We're here to beat that score!

## Tech Spec Run-Down

- Multivariable linear regression on a not-so-small dataset.
- Real-life implications and assumptions of our model – we keep it transparent.
- We've got the whole shebang – Data Wrangling, EDA, Machine Learning, and making sure we talk the talk in a way everyone gets it.

## Project Stages

1. Collect & Clean: Grabbing the data and scrubbing it till it shines.
2. Explore: Playing detective to find patterns and clues in the data.
3. Visualize: Making pretty charts that actually tell a story.
4. Machine Learning: Building and tuning models that predict loan yays and nays.
